SweetPea, a language for experimental design, attempts to generate approximately uniformly sampled trial sequences by relying on the aid of the SAT-sampler \texttt{unigen} to provide uniformity guarantees. In practice, this approach does not scale to support realistic experimental designs. The current positional encoding scheme embeds every allowed permutation of trial sequences as a unique solution. Therefore, the solution space grows factorially in the sequence length. Solution spaces of such magnitude are beyond the capabilities of current SAT-samplers to handle. This thesis presents evidence demonstrating the need for an alternative and investigates an alternative encoding, based on a bijection from natural numbers to valid trial sequences.
